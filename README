# PyPalm

PyPalm is an easy tool that should help to work with the Palm webOS SDK from the command line. Basically it should be used as a shortcut replacement for the native tools.

Pypalm can be easily installed via 

   pip install pypalm

or

   easy_install pypalm

or

   git clone git://github.com/grundprinzip/PyPalm.git && cd PyPalm && sudo python setup.py install


When installed PyPalm has installed a command line script that has the following options:

- install - install the current version on the device
- debug - launch a connection to the device
- package - package the current version of the application
- deploy -> package, install
- log - print log files
- emulator - launch the emulator
- clean - remove all ipk file

All the stupid default information is directly extracted from appinfo.json file.
